Linear Regression on Housing Dataset
1.Overview

This project applies Simple Linear Regression on Housing.csv to predict house prices using area as the feature.

ðŸ›  Libraries

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn


2.Steps
Load dataset (Housing.csv)

Select area (X) and price (y)

Split into train/test sets

Train Linear Regression model

Predict and evaluate (MAE, MSE, RÂ²)

Plot regression line (price vs area)

Print coefficient & intercept

3.Output
Metrics: MAE, MSE, RÂ²

Plot: Scatter of actual vs regression line

Interpretation: Slope (impact of area on price) and intercept
